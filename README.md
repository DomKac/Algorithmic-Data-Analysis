# Algorithmic Data Analysis

This repository contains solutions to programming assignments from the **Algorithmic Data Analysis** course, part of the second semester of the MSc in **Algorithmics** at the Faculty of Computer Science and Telecommunications, Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

## üîç Topics Covered

The course focuses on data analysis from an algorithmic perspective. The exercises cover a variety of topics, including:

- Histograms and distribution estimation
- Frequency estimation in data streams (e.g., Count-Min Sketch)
- Probabilistic algorithms (e.g., Flajolet-Martin)
- Estimating distances and similarities (e.g., MinHash, Jaccard index)
- Nearest neighbor search
- Real-time data stream processing
- Dimensionality reduction and data compression
- Scalability and complexity analysis of algorithms

## üóÇ Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific assignment list, and each `.ipynb` notebook contains detailed solutions with comments and visualizations.
